In this task, given a textual question and a list of entities with the corresponding KG subgraphs, the participating system should choose the entity that correctly answers the question. Our competition attracted thirty teams, four of which outperformed our strong ChatGPT-based zero-shot baseline. In this paper, we overview the participating systems and analyze their performance according to a large-scale automatic evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first competition aimed at the KGQA problem using the interaction between large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs."

While the commonly used metrics for evaluating the quality of Graph-to-Text models show almost perfect results, it makes it challenging to compare different approaches. This paper demonstrates the challenges of recent Graph-to-Text systems in terms of hallucinations and proposes a simple yet effective approach to using a general LLM, which has shown state-of-the-art results and reduced the number of factual hallucinations. We provide step-by-step instructions on how to develop prompts for language models and a detailed analysis of potential factual errors in the generated text."
